THE MW, MZ, SIN^2\THETA_W IS REMOVED FORM STDINPUTS.H FILE.

1. SuSemain.f:
	a) line 642: Lambda_QCD is now calculated for the given mb, alphas
	values using the function rt.
	b) tau pole mass is converted to the running mass at MZ scale.

2. OneloopPV.f:
	a) B0 function is corrected using the zlog function which takes
	complex double precision argument.

3. ewsbiterate.f:
	a) 2-loop O(alphas^2, alphas*alphat, ...) thershold corrections
	to the higgs spectrum is added using the subroutine higgs.
	b) 2-loop correction to the mu parameter is also added in the
	iterate subroutine.

4. rgeiterate.f:
	a) the corrected vev is now fed to the rge running.

5. oneloopgauge.f:
	a) alpha_em is corrected on its input value, not on the running value.
	b) alpha_s is corrected on its input value, not on the running value.

7. runrges.f:
	a) line 299: switched off the SMRGE running.
	b) changed the h1, hmin, eps value throughout the file.
	c) In all long iteration the RGEs starts at MZ scale.

9. oneloopfermion.f:
	a) changed the mass ordering and mt1, mt1 etc def. in the whole file.
	b) the mt division in all terms of mtcorrection is now mtpole.
	c) the mb division in all terms of mbcorrection is now mbpole.
	d) momentum argument for PVs changed to mbpole from 2X10^-5
	e) line 1406: mtau --> 2X10^-5 (m_\nu)
	f) line 1436: removed the extra 1/2 factor from the 2nd line.
	g) the mtau division in all terms of mtaucorrection is now mtaupole.

10. softspectrum.f:
	a) all the 2X2 diagonalisations gives the eigenvalues in the ascending order.
